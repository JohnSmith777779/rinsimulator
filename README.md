# rinsimulator

Rin Simulator is a visual novel style game currently being developed by SpitfireMk2b-san. It is supposed to let you talk to Rin with an affection level system and some other fun features, but those aren’t done yet, so the current Beta is just testing a few things to see if the basics work.

As of this writing, I’m the only one working on the project. If you want to help out, please don't hesitate to join the Discord! https://discord.gg/xnXbc8F
